            <h2>Background:</h2>
            <p>Moynat is a French luxury brand that started out as trunk maker brand since 1849, competing with other trunk makers in the 19thcentury such as Louis Vuitton and Goyard. Today Moynat is known for its high-grade leather goods, and detailed craftmanship of each purse. Stitched and lacquered by hand, each purse is created by an individual craftsman from start to finish, which makes Moynat purses distinctive pieces for a woman’s closet. I wanted to improve the pre-ordering experience for clients in-store that went beyond the brick and mortar store itself. 

            </p>
            
            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <h3>I believe that by creating a digital catalogue for Moynat first-time shoppers and Moynat shopper’s making their second purchase we will garner a higher interest in customers wanting to purchase a bag. We will know this to be true when there is an increase in pre-orders for purses.  <h3>
            <p>Although Moynat is was considered a new brand in Singapore, the brand was rapidly expanding in Asia with boutiques in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea, and China. We had purse enthusiasts invest in the classic Rejane bag, but found through qualitative data that majority of the cases were one off purchases.  </p>

            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p>I conducted a comparative  analysis test with other podcast listening applications as well as a meditation application to compare the user interface of listening screens and discover podcast screens. I chose to focus on listening screens to see which features (e.g playback speed, sleep timer, customizing rewind speed, etc.) were prioritized in Spotify’s podcast listening experience in comparison to others. Additionally, I wanted to test if discovering different podcasts have been made accessible to listeners. </p>
            
            <h2>Research</h2>
            

            <h4>Quantitative Research</h4>
            <p>After finding out more about customer purchase behavior, I was surprised to find qualitative data that majority of the cases were one off purchases. I was curious to find out more why customers chose not to purchase more than one purse. Although clients had a genuine interest to purchase a purse upon arriving at the store, when offered to pre-order a handcrafted purse, most clients were deterred upon the suggestion.  </p>

            <h4>Qualitative Research</h4>
            <p>I proceeded to conduct a few interviews to find out why were the decisions clients made when thinking about purchasing a purse. </p>
            


            <h2>User Interviews Key Findings</h2>
            <p><b>“I find it time consuming to scroll through a list of podcasts within the genres”  </b></p>
            <p><b>“I’m usually following the name of a company when I’m searching for a podcast to listen to.” </b></p>
            <p><b>“I usually stick to one podcast show because there’s a weekly upload” </b></p>
