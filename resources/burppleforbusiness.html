            <h2>Background:</h2>
            <p>Burpple is Singapore’s #1 food recommendation website. Partnering with over 500 restaurants in Singapore, Burpple introduced its Beyond Program in 2018 to provide food-lovers one-for-one deals using an annual membership plan. Burpple Beyond is one of the three services that Burpple provides for businesses, and I was tasked to revamp the Burpple for Business page to better present the three services that Burpple provides for businesses: Beyond Program, claim your business page, and the ability for business owners to advertise with Burpple.  </p>
            
            <h2>Hypothesis</h2>
            <p>We believe that by creating a clearer message about Burpple’s services for merchants through Burpple’s claim your page landing page, we will achieve higher claims of listings. We will know this to be true when the number of claims have increased. </p>

            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <h3>Burpple merchants need a way to easily claim their business page because there’s a potential to increase volume of customer visits to their venues, which would benefit both merchants and Burpple. </h3>
            
            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>To help validate my hypothesis I did some qualitative research as well as quantitative research to find the root for low number of claims. </p>

            <h4>Qualitative Research</h4>
            <p>From observing the user flow trends on Google Analytics and Amplitude, I noticed a large number of drop-offs of page visitors on the “Claim my Business” page. 

                *Statistics won’t be published due to privacy reasons</p>
            
            <h4>Quantitative Research</h4>
            <p>I conducted a short interview with business owners and asked them the following questions:</p>
                <ol>Did you know you can claim your business on Burpple? </ol>
                <ol>Why or why not?</ol>
            <p></p>

            <h2>User Interviews Key Findings</h2>
            <p><b>“I find it time consuming to scroll through a list of podcasts within the genres”  </b></p>
            <p><b>“I’m usually following the name of a company when I’m searching for a podcast to listen to.” </b></p>
            <p><b>“I usually stick to one podcast show because there’s a weekly upload” </b></p>
