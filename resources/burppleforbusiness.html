            <h2>Background:</h2>
            <p>Burpple is Singapore’s #1 food recommendation website. Partnering with over 500 restaurants in Singapore, Burpple introduced its Beyond Program in 2018 to provide food-lovers one-for-one deals using an annual membership plan. Burpple Beyond is one of the three services that Burpple provides for businesses, and I was tasked to revamp the Burpple for Business page to better present the three services that Burpple provides for businesses: Beyond Program, claim your business page, and the ability for business owners to advertise with Burpple.  </p>
            
            <h2>Hypothesis</h2>
            <p>We believe that by creating a clearer message about Burpple’s services for merchants through Burpple’s claim your page landing page, we will achieve higher claims of listings. We will know this to be true when the number of claims have increased. </p>

            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <h3>Burpple merchants need a way to easily claim their business page because there’s a potential to increase volume of customer visits to their venues, which would benefit both merchants and Burpple. </h3>
            
            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>To help validate my hypothesis I did some qualitative research as well as quantitative research to find the root for low number of claims. </p>

            <h4>Qualitative Research</h4>
            <p>From observing the user flow trends on Google Analytics and Amplitude, I noticed a large number of drop-offs of page visitors on the “Claim my Business” page. 

                *Statistics won’t be published due to privacy reasons</p>
            
            <h4>Quantitative Research</h4>
            <p>I conducted a short interview with business owners and asked them the following questions:</p>
                <ol>Did you know you can claim your business on Burpple? </ol>
                <ol>Why or why not?</ol>
            <p> For my user interviews, I mainly asked the managers of chain restaurants, if the marketing team was absent. As I thought managers would have a more informed idea of the restaurant’s online presence after the marketing teams. Likewise, I interviewed owners of smaller businesses, such as bubble-tea kiosk owners to find out if there were any differences in increasing visitor traffic at restaurants versus kiosk-stores. The goal of this interview was to understand if business owners were aware of the services that Burpple provided, and find out why business owners didn’t claim their page when presented the option. </p>
              
            <h2>Speaking to food vendors</h2>
            <p>An interesting observation I made while carrying out my user interviews, was that many restaurant managers and business owners would access Burpple’s claim my page on their mobile site, as there was a lack of computers in store. This observation helped emphasize the importance of creating the Burpple for Business page on mobile, in addition to web despite the limited resources. </p>

            </div>
            <p>Using the collected data, I went back to Burpple for Business page to see what were the improvements that could be made to create a more informative page for businesses owners. </p>

            <h2>Wireframes</h2>

            </div>

            <h2>The pivot</h2>
            <p>During this project, more business features were recently added to the home page such as the options for restaurants to be a Beyond partner, and restaurant owners to advertise with Burpple. It felt appropriate to group the “claim my business” page with Burpple’s other services, thus during ideation I created a Burpple for Business page to showcase all three services, which enacted the pivot.</p>
            <div class="imagebox">
                <img src="./images/burpplepivot.png" alt="Burpple wireframes">
            </div>

            <p> With the given pages, we re-considered creating individual pages to explain what each service could do for restaurants so as to enhance user flow. However, to create each individual page would take time to produce. Without compromising the user flow, we made use of existing features created and decided upon creating a landing page to present Burpple’s all three services, and allowed restaurant owners to fill out an interest form after. </p>
            <div class="imagebox">
                <img src="./images/burppleuserflow.png" alt="Burpple wireframes">
            </div>
            <p>During this process, we changed the objective of creating a new “claim my business” page to producing a more informative Burpple for Business landing page to create awareness amongst businesses about Burpple’s advertising, Beyond program and claiming a business. </p>
            <p>Upon meeting with the product manager, the iPhone screenshot feature did not end up being delivered. After comparing the two pages, the page with an annotated phone gave the wrong impression to users about being solely a “claim you business” page instead of opportunities for business development with Burpple. Hence, the team decided to move the iPhone screenshot feature to a confirmation email, which would create a better onboarding experience for business owners upon claiming their businesses.</p>

            <h2>What's Next?</h2>
            <ul> 
                <li><b>Making it more obvious for business owners to claim their pages on mobile</b></li>
                <p>During my user research interviews, I noticed most self-owned café owners and kiosk-owners accessed Burpple pages through their mobile phones and didn’t have a laptop in-store for use. Hence, I think it would be vital to create a more engaging experience on mobile for business owners. </p>
                <li><b>Standardization of forms in following pages </b></li>
                <p>Currently the form for business owners to claim their page uses the old format, and I would love to make it similar to the rate card request form and beyond partner forms. </p>
            </ul>
           

            <h2>Takeaways</h2>
            <p>Being one of my first UX design projects with a team, it was exciting to be able to solve real-life problems. Within a short timeline, I had the opportunity to be work on this project end-to end, leading UX research, sketching, wireframing, prototyping, and conceptualizing the design. This project taught me to be flexible and open in ideation, and it is okay to think outside the initial objective. This project is valuable to me as I learnt firsthand from working off pre-existing designs, which made me realize there is constant re-iterations in product, beyond creating new products from scratch.</p>
