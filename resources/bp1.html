        <h2>Internal gymnastics of being a creative</h2>
        <div class="date">

        </div>
        <p>This labour day weekend, I watched "Abstract, The Art of Design," the episode featuring Christoph Neimann, an
            illustrator whose works are often in the New Yorker, the New York Times and The National Geographic, while
            waiting for brownies to bake in the oven. In this episode, Niemann walks the audience through his
            illustration career and creative processes. Living in New York in Berlin, Niemann's life heavily influences
            his everyday work. </p>
        <p>Through the video montage of him drawing on whiteboards, window panes or just at his desk, what amazes me is
            how Niemann injects a casual-ness in his illustrations and ideas. For example, the childlike nature of
            playing with lego forces the creator to think in a pixel-like manner, in which color blocks help convey an
            object. The use of colored blocks and different sizes of lego simplifies the process on how we view things,
            but creates a light-hearted nature to how Niemann uses lego to deliver a message. Using wide grey lego
            blocks, he uses a thin strip to portray the northern facade of the flatiron building and wider pieces to
            show the differences in surface area of the eastern and southern facade.</p>
        <p>It is not surprising that he has translated this into his daily illustrations that can be seen on his
            Instagram, @abstractsunday. He incorporates everyday objects into mini animations and sketches. My favourite
            is the army-green T-rex outlined with watercolours running away with a real-life sock on its head. I found
            this segment of the episode especially relieving as a designer. During formal design sessions there are
            always multiple iterations, critiques and back and fourth to communicate a customer's needs. At points in
            time, it can detract from an artist's creativity and dampen the spirit of being able to run wild with your
            ideas. Niemann expresses through his Sundaysketches the experimentation, lack of control and idling nature
            of creativity which makes me excited about design and art.</p>
        <p>When proposed with a statement about Niemann "It almost seems like the creator of your pieces and the editor
            of your pieces are two different people". Niemann provides a raw take on how he perceives himself as a
            creator and the battle between having control of his own designs versus allowing himself to be more free
            spirited. I was able to empathize with this internal tug-of-war of being "ruthless in editing [my] designs",
            but also being "a careless artist". As a self-proclaimed worry-wart I love the idea of risk taking only when
            they are calculated risks. As I have gotten older, it seems like there are more self-enacted deadlines and
            inadvertently less time for me to tinker and play. It is reassuring to know Niemann faces these struggles.
        </p>
        <p>Watching this episode has reminded me not to create time for idling, but also allow myself to action on a
            sudden thought. I hope to be able to exude Niemann's humbleness towards taking conscientious steps towards
            trying things I am uncomfortable with as a designer and to not be too critical of myself while in the
            process of learning.</p>
