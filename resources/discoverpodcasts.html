            <h2>Background:</h2>
            <p>In the past few months, Spotify has spent over $400 million on podcast content and technology by acquiring Podcast companies such as Gimlet and Parcast, as well as podcast hosting platforms such as Anchor to create a diversification of content on Spotify besides just music. Although there is a clear indication Spotify wants to put an equal focus on podcast listening in their application, there are still connotations for the application to be solely used for listening to music. According to Apple, over 60% of podcast listening still happens on Apple’s default podcast application. As a result, Spotify has shown a clear indication of getting its 217 million monthly active listeners to stream more podcast content. With new features such as Daily Drive - which incorporates shorts podcast episodes with music for commuters. 

            I’ve been a podcast listener since 2017 and did the transition from listening to podcasts on Apple to Spotify about a year ago. Given the emphasis on podcast listening on Spotify, I was wondering if the podcast listening experience could be better on Spotify. </p>
            
            <h2>Hypothesis</h2>
            <p>The problem I suspect is that people don’t listen to podcasts regularly as it requires active listening, and it is difficult to discover podcasts that listeners may like. </p>
        

            <h2>Phase 1: Understand</h2>
            <p>I conducted a comparative  analysis test with other podcast listening applications as well as a meditation application to compare the user interface of listening screens and discover podcast screens. I chose to focus on listening screens to see which features (e.g playback speed, sleep timer, customizing rewind speed, etc.) were prioritized in Spotify’s podcast listening experience in comparison to others. Additionally, I wanted to test if discovering different podcasts have been made accessible to listeners. </p>
            
            <h2>Looking at the features offered when users are listening</h2>
            <div class="imagebox">
                <img src="./images/Comparative Analysis.png" alt="Comparative Analysis">
            </div>
           
            <p>Spotify and Apple have very similar UI and features, presumably because both companies target a wider listening audience in comparison to more tailored applications such as Headspace (meditation app) and Pocket Casts (strictly a podcast listening application). Both Spotify and Apple have similar features (e.g speed adjustment, rewind/fast forward, and sleep timer). Whereas Pocket Casts seems to have a larger variety of features, and a navigation bar with customizable features. While having more options during podcast listening may seem intuitive, having many buttons may seem intimidating for new users. Thus I looked at Headspace’s UI to gain a new perspective of listening experiences - a simple screen with 2 features (a pause and play button, and timer). Given meditation having a large emphasis on being present and requiring users to close their eyes, Headspace’s minimal UI seems on theme with the connotations of meditation, which might be difficult to emulate in podcast listening experiences. </p>
            <div class="imagebox">
                <img src="./images/Comparative Analysis - Discover Podcasts.png" alt="Comparative Analysis-Discover Podcasts">
            </div>
            
            <p>Recalling my hypothesis of difficulty of discovering new podcasts, I chose to look at the discover page in each application, which were all varied. Spotify’s discovery page was personalized based on timing followed by curated playlists based on situations, followed by a list of general categories. Both Apple Podcasts and Pocket Casts have similar hierarchy of content, with varying shapes to help users distinguish between new featured podcasts, podcast hosts, and curated collections. Although it looks interactive, there seems to be a prioritization of featuring what is new or popular instead of personalization features. In contrast, since Headspace produces their own content, there’s a simple categorization with friendly doodles to each category. </p>

            <h2>User Interviews Key Findings</h2>
            <p>To validate my hypothesis I proceeded to conduct interviews with users of ranging experiences that listen to podcasts. Having a range of experiences with podcasts, I was able to discover the different user behaviours when listening and discovering podcasts, pain points, but also find common trends, which helped me map out a users’ needs in Spotify podcast listening. Here are some quotes from the sessions:</p>
            <p><b>“I find it time consuming to scroll through a list of podcasts within the genres”  </b></p>
            <p><b>“I’m usually following the name of a company when I’m searching for a podcast to listen to.” </b></p>
            <p><b>“I usually stick to one podcast show because there’s a weekly upload” </b></p>
            
            <h2>Phase 2: Define</h2>
            <p>I created 3 personas from my interviews to understand the reasons why users have specific behaviours and preferences towards podcast listening. </p>
            <div class="imagebox">
                <img src="./images/spotifypersona.png" alt="Spotify Persona">
            </div>
            
            <p>From my user interviews I affirmed my hypothesis of people not listening to podcasts regularly as users find it difficult to discover new ones. Thus, I chose to refine my problem statement towards creating a better discovery experience. </p>

            <h2>Putting it onto paper</h2>
            <div class="imagebox">
                <img src="./images/Wireframe.png" alt="Spotify Persona">
            </div>
            
            <p>After refining my user flow and performing a card sorting test to determine which features should be grouped together by users. I created a lo-fidelity prototype for testing. This MVP allowed for identifying buttons that were missed out in the user flow. (e.g the back button) and it also allowed for elaboration of certain features such as the browsing features and the slide down features. Initially I thought of showing just 6 with podcasters at the bottom but decided change it to an infinite scroll feature as users wanted more options.</p>

            <h2>Refined Problem Statement</h2>
            <h3>Podcast listeners need a way to easily discover podcasts because finding new podcast to listen to can be time consuming, and users are lazy. </h3>

            <h2>Ideation</h2>
            <h3>Prioritization Matrix</h3>
            <div class="imagebox">
                <img src="./images/spotifyprioritizationmatrix.png" alt="Spotify Prioritization Matrix">
            </div>
            
            
            <p>I brainstormed on a bunch of features based on the users’ pain points, and created a prioritization matrix. Given the limited time to create prototype, I decided to focus on creating features that were between the categories of low effort and essential in making the discover podcast feature work. 

                I drew inspiration from the pre-existing discover features for music. Such as the ‘liked heart’, and ‘don’t like’ button as well as the recommended songs feature when users scroll down on existing playlists. </p>
                
                
                <p>Before creating a lo fidelity prototype, I went back to conduct a few user surveys to see how users may classify certain features. I led an open card sort exercise to identify whether users were familiar with podcast discovering and created an affinity map. </p>
                <div class="imagebox">
                    <img src="./images/info-hier.png" alt="Affinity Map">
                </div>
                
                
                <p>During my card sort I noticed users distinguished a difference between discovering based on personal preferences versus the discovery process (usually found on the home page) generally. I decided to create sub containers to further categorize these differences and placed “browse other podcasts” in the discover daily container and discover similar episodes to recommended podcasts.

                    Even though I added features such as trending podcasts and new podcasts, I eventually decided not to add them into my prototype as users didn’t express that they listened to what’s trending or new but mainly based on their personal preferences. 
                    
                     I refined Spotify’s user flow to incorporate a discover podcasts feature. </p>
                
                     <div class="imagebox">
                        <img src="./images/userflow.png" alt="Refined User Flow">
                     </div>
                     
        
        
            <p>After refining my user flow and performing a card sorting test to determine which features should be grouped together by users. I created a lo-fidelity prototype for testing. This MVP allowed for identifying buttons that were missed out in the user flow. (e.g the back button) and it also allowed for elaboration of certain features such as the browsing features and the slide down features. Initially I thought of showing just 6 with podcasters at the bottom but decided change it to an infinite scroll feature as users wanted more options.</p>
        
            <h2>Usability Testing</h2>
            <p>During usability testing I set out three tasks for the user to do:</p>
            <ol> 
                <li>Explore similar podcasts</li>
                <li>Queue an episode</li>
                <li>Find the description of the podcast</li>
            </ol>

            <p>I was surprised to find out some of my users did not notice they were able to slide down to discover more episodes.  Additionally, users didn’t know they were exploring podcasts that were similar to the current one they were listening to. Thus, I created a discover toggle button as a re-iteration to emphasize that users were able to find new podcasts to listen to as well as a guiding pop-up screen. It was affirming to know the gestures used for the intended buttons were used correctly. </p>
            
            <h2>Listening to Feedback</h2>
            <p><b>Missing the discover toggle </b></p>
            <p>I assumed mobile users would use similar gestures, but was disproved as I realized Android users and Apple Users use certain buttons differently. For example android users are more familiar with the 3 dots menu to view extra options. Android users gravitated towards finding a menu button when trying to discover music instead of clicking the toggle button.  </p>
            <p><b>Finding the description of podcasts easily.</b></p>
            <p>Adding a podcast cover behind, to make artwork look flippable to nudge users that the cover had an interaction with it.</p>
          
            <h2>Finalise</h2>
            <video width="640" height="360" autoplay loop>
                <source src="./images/Discover Podcasts.mov" type="video/mp4" style="width: 50vw; min-width: 220px;">
              </video>  
              
            <h2>What’s Next?</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><b>To change gestures and buttons for android users</b></li>
                <ul>
                    <li> I realized that majority of the users I interviewed have a desk bound job and do express that they listen to music and podcasts at work. I thought as an expansion feature it would be great to have a discover feature for desktop. </li>
                </ul>
                <li><b>A more detailed on boarding feature for discovery.</b> </li>
                <ul>
                    <li> Currently there is a pop-up description that tells users what they can do with discover, but would love to have a more visual onboarding feature for users to be able to navigate the features of discover podcasts easily in the future. </li>
                </ul>
            </ol>
            
            <h2>Takeaways</h2>
            <p>The diversification of audio content has been a great business move for Spotify. Being a podcast lover, I enjoyed conceptualizing this project to introduce new podcast listeners to the world of podcast listening. To my surprise, a few weeks later Spotify released a podcast episode page with a “You might also like” suggestion feature in their application. 

                This project has allowed me to grow an affinity towards experimenting with dark mode design, as well as rigorous usability testing for feedback on creating a better discovery experience. </p>
